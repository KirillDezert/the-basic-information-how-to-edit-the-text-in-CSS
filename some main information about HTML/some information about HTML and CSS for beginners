So here I would like explain to you how to use different attributies in CSS and also in HTML, and first our attribute "font-weight",
font-weight using in order to do our text more fat and also upside down more skinny or mark this text like importent with help "font-weight: bold;", but also in order to mark the HTML text on our page like
important we can use also "<em>" and that looks like this:"<p10 class="Beauty"><em> about beautiful places in Switzerland</em></p10>" and like this I marked this part of my HTML text like important part,
what about classes, in that example which I already wrote, already there is class and his name and with help this name I can start to edit this part of my text and we can edit this part whatever with help "style"
right in HTML document or we can do that in CSS document only for this we should relate our HTML file with file CSS and this looks like this ""<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">"
and after this we can edit our elements in CSS
